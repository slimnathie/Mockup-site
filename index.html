            <p>A junior student at the Royal Academy of Music and later a graduate from Trinity College of Music, London, John realised early on that composing was to be the driving force in his life. As a lover of musical improvisation, he was also attracted to modern jazz and rock based forms and upon leaving college signed to Acid Jazz records as The Apostles. He released and featured on several original albums with the label, including The Apostles, Mo Jazz and the Totally Wired series. Mixing up rare groove samples, jazz keyboards and rap vocals, The Apostles were regarded as one of the significant early artists in the history of Acid Jazz.<br><br>

                    <p>John's music has the power to bring a film to life and add an extra layer of emotion and drama</p>

                </blockquote>

                Creating image driven music had always been John's passion, and he began to incorporate his varied influences to produce and compose soundtrack scores. Initially writing works for short films, commissions for television work soon followed, beginning with the score for the BBC Trench series - a dramatic portrayal of life in a front line trench during the Battle of the Somme.<br><br>

                <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
                    <p>John is an extremely thoughtful and creative composer... he is a pleasure to work with</p>
                    <footer>Mark Hedgecoe <cite title="Source Title">Executive Producer</cite></footer>
                </blockquote>

                Combining themes with an individual approach to harmony, his distinctive style became characteristic of several subsequent scores, including Richard the Lionheart and Spartacus for the BBC Heroes and Villains drama series, the WGBH Nova series, Operation Crossbow and D Day The Last Heroes for BBC1.<br><br>
                Excerpts of these scores and others can be found on the audio page.
